# **NOTION TO GOOGLECALENDAR**
This app aims to synchronize notion databases with google calendar. For now the feature is still limited to sync one fixed notion database with google calendar access which is limited to personal google calendar only.   
&nbsp;       
## **Reasons for creating this application**
I made this application driven by the desire to relearn Golang and at exact time when i develop my second brain with notion. The hope is not only with google calendar but with other notetaking apps.   
&nbsp;
## **List to do**
- &#9745; Automation to synchronize new/updated notion database entries to google calendar and vice versa
- &#9744; Automation for recurring notion entries
- &#9744; API support for  
  - &#9744; Dynamic notion databases column   
  - &#9744; Dynamic email/calendar  
-  &#9744; Creating tasks, reminder, and goal on google calendar from notion
